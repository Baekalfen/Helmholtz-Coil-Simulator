Helmholtz-Coil-Simulator
========================

A very simple Helmholtz coil simulator I made for my physics exam in early 2013.

 It is well-organized, but only very lightly commented. I made it before i learned about the object-oriented part of Python.

There are 4 versions:
main.py
main_grid.py
main_grid_threaded.py
main_grid_threaded_layer.py

A basic rule: the shorter the name, the earlier the version.

main_grid_threaded_layer.py should be bug-free and I have tested it on multiple computers running OS X, Linux and Windows. The earlier version are mostly to see the iteration of the software and help to understand the code.
